# LSTM and LSTM Autoencoder implementation in Pytorch
This repository consists of code for implementation of LSTM and LSTM-AE in Pytorch. </br>
The main/ extensive implementation and documentation can be found in: https://github.com/danielstankw/Anomaly-Detection, where I used Tensorflow. 
This repository was used as a playground, to compare Pytorch and Tensorflow implementation of LSTMs and compare their prediction times.
